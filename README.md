# Loan-Prediction-Project
Description:
A machine learning project to predict loan approval using customer demographic and financial data.

üìñ Project Overview

  This project aims to build a predictive model to determine whether a loan will be approved or rejected based on customer and financial features. 
The workflow includes:

  Data preprocessing and handling missing values

  Exploratory data visualization

  Feature encoding and scaling

  Model building using Logistic Regression with balanced class weight

Evaluation on train and test sets using accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC AUC

üìÇ Dataset

üìä Results

Model Performance:

| Dataset | Accuracy | ROC AUC | Observations                                                   |
| ------- | -------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Train   | 76.6%    | 0.718   | Balanced predictive power; high recall for approved loans      |
| Test    | 74.8%    | 0.699   | Model generalizes well; consistent performance with train data |

Key Insights:

Model predicts approved loans (class 1) very well.

Recall for rejected loans (class 0) is moderate but consistent.

Small difference between train and test metrics indicates no severe overfitting.

Random Forest

| Dataset | Accuracy | ROC AUC | Observations                                                       |
| ------- | -------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Train   | 100%     | 1.0     | Perfect fit on training data (possible overfitting)                |
| Test    | 78.0%    | 0.702   | High recall for approved loans; moderate recall for rejected loans |

Key Insights:

Both models perform better on approved loans (class 1).

Recall for rejected loans (class 0) is moderate but consistent.

Logistic Regression generalizes better, while Random Forest shows perfect training accuracy but slightly lower test performance, indicating some overfitting.

üîÆ Future Work

Feature engineering to improve prediction for rejected loans

Deploy as a web application for real-time loan approval prediction
